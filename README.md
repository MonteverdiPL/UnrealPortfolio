# Unreal Engine Skills Showcase

Welcome to my Unreal Engine Skills Showcase repository! I have been professionally working in the gaming industry for 5 years. I started as a tester, and now, if I were to describe my position with one term, I'd call myself a Technical Designer. Although I have experience as a Developer and Project Manager as well.

This portfolio exists because in a professional setting, you can't always do things exactly the way you want to. It's a place where I can do things my way and for the sheer enjoyment of it. Explore the various projects and examples that illustrate my experience and abilities.

## About Me
I am Robert, an experienced technical designer with 5 years of experience in the gaming industry. I have worked on various projects such as Uzuzu Golf, Unbound, Door Kickers, Hong Kong Massacre, and many others. Each of these projects, in some way, has prepared me for even larger endeavors. 

## What You'll Find in This Repository

### 1. Level Design Projects
The repository contains examples of level design projects. Creating engaging and playable levels is one of my favorite activities, and these projects serve as a testament to my skills in this area.

### 2. Scripts and Code
I also showcase my programming skills in Unreal Engine. You'll find code snippets, solutions, and script examples that I use in my projects. I mainly used Blueprints for my work, but recently, I've been learning C++ programming to enhance my skills. Examples of C++ code can be found in this portfolio.

### 3. Documentation
Some projects come with documentation that describes my approach to design and problem-solving. I aim for this repository to be a place where others can learn more about my creative process.
